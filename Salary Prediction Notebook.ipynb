    "Given the known salary for a big set of Job ID listings along with some known (relevant) features, i.e. Company ID, Job Type, Degree, Major, Industry, Years Experience, and Distance from Metropolitan, we would would like to develop a machine learned statistical model to predict the salary for another dataset of Job ID postings with the same features as the ones for jobs having known salaries. In other words, we train our model based on the Job ID dataset with known salaries and, then, test it on the Job ID dataset with unknown salaries. This is a supervised machine learning problem for lots of applications like glassdoor in order to predict salary for any given Job ID, e.g. position."
